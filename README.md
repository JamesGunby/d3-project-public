# d3-project-public
My final project for an undergraduate course on Visualization. Created with JavaScript, HTML, CSS and D3.

## Information

As part of my 4th-year Visualization course, we were instructed to find data sets and create a visualization tool to visualize the data in an easily interpretable way.

The data I chose to use from the project was complied by Berkley Earth and hosted on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data/data

This chosen data comprises of climate data spanning from the 18th century to 21st century. For the sake of accuracy, I limited the data to the 1920s and later. In order to best demonstrate changes in climate over time, I decided to have it represented by a pair of maps side-by-side where the user can change the represented month and year for each map individually, allowing for at-a-glance views of the change. A second line graph is also represented that shows the global average temperature for a selected month over time from 1920 to 2013. The user can also select a country for the line graph to see how that country's climate has changed over time.

## Set up
